# Agent Distillation in Samus

## Overview

Agent distillation in Samus is a sophisticated knowledge transfer mechanism that enables sharing capabilities between different agent instances and model configurations. This process allows successful MCPs (Model Context Protocols) developed by one agent to be adapted and inherited by another agent, even when using different underlying models.

## Core Concepts

### What is Agent Distillation?

Agent distillation is the process of:
1. **Extracting** high-performing capabilities from a source agent
2. **Analyzing** their performance and transferability characteristics  
3. **Adapting** them for compatibility with target model configurations
4. **Installing** them as inherited capabilities in a new agent instance

This enables knowledge accumulation and sharing across the Samus agent ecosystem.

### Key Components

The distillation system consists of four main components:

1. **MCPPerformanceAnalyzer** - Evaluates and ranks MCPs for distillation
2. **ModelCompatibilityAdapter** - Adapts MCPs for different target models
3. **AgentDistillationEngine** - Orchestrates the entire distillation process
4. **DistilledAgent** - Agent class that inherits capabilities from other agents

## Architecture

```
Source Agent MCPs → Performance Analysis → Model Adaptation → Target Agent
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
[MCPs with metrics] → [Ranking & filtering] → [Model-specific] → [Inherited
                                                adaptation]        capabilities]
```

## Distillation Process

### Phase 1: Performance Analysis

**MCPPerformanceAnalyzer** evaluates each MCP across multiple dimensions:

```python
@dataclass
class MCPPerformanceProfile:
    success_rate: float              # Execution success percentage
    avg_execution_time: float        # Performance efficiency
    cost_per_execution: float        # Economic efficiency
    usage_frequency: int             # Popularity indicator
    complexity_tier: str             # lightweight/moderate/expert
    model_compatibility: Dict        # Cross-model performance scores
    domain_effectiveness: Dict       # Domain-specific effectiveness
    user_satisfaction: float         # Derived satisfaction score
    error_rate: float               # Reliability metric
```

**Distillation Scoring Formula:**
```
score = (success_rate × 0.3) + 
        (user_satisfaction × 0.25) + 
        (capped_usage_frequency × 0.2) + 
        (stability × 0.15) + 
        (transferability × 0.1)
```

### Phase 2: Filtering and Selection

MCPs are filtered based on:
- **Performance Threshold** - Minimum distillation score required
- **Max MCPs Limit** - Maximum number of capabilities to transfer
- **Domain Relevance** - Relevance to target use cases

### Phase 3: Model Adaptation

**ModelCompatibilityAdapter** modifies MCPs for target models:

1. **Model Assignment Updates**
   - Primary model assignment
   - Provider configuration (anthropic/openai/google)
   - Fallback model chains

2. **Complexity Adjustment**
   - Adapts complexity tier based on target model capabilities
   - Maintains or reduces complexity for less capable models

3. **Prompt Adaptation**
   - Model-specific prompt formatting
   - Provider-specific instruction styles

4. **Performance Reset**
   - Clears source model performance metrics
   - Initializes tracking for new model context

### Phase 4: Installation and Tracking

**DistilledAgent** receives adapted MCPs and:
- Installs them in the local MCP repository
- Tracks inherited vs. generated capability usage
- Maintains distillation metadata and lineage
- Enables continued evolution of inherited capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Distillation

```bash
# Distill current agent capabilities to Claude Haiku
samus distill --target-model "anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku" \
              --performance-threshold 0.7 \
              --max-mcps 10
```

### Export/Import Workflow

```bash
# Export distilled capabilities
samus distill --target-model "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet" \
              --export-path "team_mcps.json"

# Import capabilities to new agent
samus import-mcps "team_mcps.json" \
                  --target-model "openai/gpt-4"
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# View agent statistics
samus stats

# Output:
# Agent Statistics:
#   Total MCPs: 15
#   High Performance MCPs: 8
#   Average Success Rate: 0.82
#   Inherited MCPs: 5
#   Generated MCPs: 10
```

## Distillation Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics to measure distillation effectiveness:

```python
@dataclass
class DistillationMetrics:
    transfer_success_rate: float     # % of MCPs successfully transferred
    performance_retention: float     # Estimated performance preservation
    adaptation_quality: float        # Quality of model adaptation
    execution_compatibility: float   # Runtime compatibility score
    cost_efficiency: float          # Economic efficiency post-transfer
    transfer_time: float            # Time taken for distillation
```

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Model Compatibility

The system supports distillation across different model providers:

- **Anthropic Models**: Claude 3.5 Haiku, Sonnet, Opus
- **OpenAI Models**: GPT-4, O1-Preview
- **Google Models**: Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash

### Domain-Specific Effectiveness

MCPs are analyzed for effectiveness across domains:
- **Data Analysis**: CSV processing, statistical analysis
- **Web APIs**: HTTP requests, API orchestration
- **File Processing**: Document manipulation, text processing
- **Mathematical**: Calculations, formula processing
- **Visualization**: Charts, graphs, dashboards
- **Financial**: Trading algorithms, market analysis

### Capability Evolution

Inherited MCPs can continue evolving in the new agent context:

```python
# Evolve an inherited capability based on usage feedback
success = await distilled_agent.evolve_inherited_capability(
    mcp_id="inherited_mcp_123",
    feedback={"performance_issue": "slow_execution", "improvement": "caching"}
)
```
